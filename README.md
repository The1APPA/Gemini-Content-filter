# Gemini-Content-filter
This project is a FastAPI-based product review moderation and authenticity checking service. It allows users to submit product reviews through a simple API and ensures that each review is safe to post and likely written by a human. The backend integrates with the Google Gemini API to perform real-time analysis of review content, detecting profanity, spam, or other inappropriate language and identifying whether the review appears to be generated by a bot. Reviews are categorized by sentiment based on their rating, and safe, human-written reviews are stored in an in-memory list accessible through an endpoint. The application also supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making it compatible with local HTML clients. Logging is enabled for monitoring review submissions and Gemini responses, and environment variables are loaded securely through a .env file. The service can be run locally using Uvicorn on port 8000.

To run:
1) create a .env file with 1 line " GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY" "
2) run  uvicorn server:app --reload
3) open "product_review.html"
4) Post a review on the web page
